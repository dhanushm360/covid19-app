# Antivirus: The Ultimate COVID-19 Tracker

This project is aims to display the real numbers behind the COVID-19 pandemic. For now, it is only supported for IOS devices, but I plan to move to Android as well in the near future.

## About the Project

I have built and developed this mobile application for two main reasons: To help people around the world view the trends of the pandemic, and for my own enjoyability. I wanted something that was readily accessible and had the most information you could get all within a mobile application.

## How it Works

This mobile application uses your location and fetches COVID-19 data based on your county, state and country. The data which includes cases, deaths and vaccinations are fetched from a live API that is updated daily. The fetched data is then displayed right on your screen. There is also a search implementation within the application. The search is used to search for states or countries, and displaying extensive COVID-19 data on whatever the search is.

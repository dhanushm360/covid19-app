# Antivirus: The Ultimate COVID-19 Tracker

This project is aims to display the real numbers behind the COVID-19 pandemic. For now, it is only supported for IOS devices, but I plan to move to Android as well in the near future.

## About the Project

I have built and developed this mobile application for two main reasons: To help people around the world view the trends of the pandemic, and for my own enjoyability. I wanted something that was readily accessible and had the most information you could get all within a mobile application.
